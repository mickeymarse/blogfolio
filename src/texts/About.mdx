I am **Mickey** and use **_they/them_** pronouns.\
I am a a former <span className='text-neonp'>baker</span> turned <span className='text-neonp'>developer</span> who
turns into a <span className='text-neonp'>writer</span> in their spare time.\
 _What do all these things have in common?_ you might be asking yourself.\
 Well, they're all about **creating stories**!\
 Writing _speculative fiction_ let me weave the fate of entire unseen universes, shape
never-heard-of-before worlds, mold unimaginable creatures who live otherwise undescribable lives.\
 As for _food_, it carries the stories of entire cultures and generations within its individual
components, every single one of them enriched but its own history. The type of flour used or the
way a dough is folded can make you jump within time and space faster than a Google search.\
 And then, well, there is <Code code='code' className='text-neonp' inline/>.

We've been hanging out for years, but we became close friends only recently.\
From <span className='text-neonp font-bold'>myspace</span> to blogging as a teen to becoming a <span className='text-neonp font-bold'>Linux</span> user in my 20s up until self-hosting and dabbling with **freeCodeCamp** and the likes.\
Then, last year, everything changed.\
I decided to go _all-in_ and I got selected by [**School of Code**](https://www.schoolofcode.com/), an intensive 16-week web development bootcamp. And I enjoyed every second of it.\
I **learnt how to learn**, to work in a dev team, to think computationally, to fall in love with problems rather than solutions.\
More importantly, I saw how code is not just a bunch of commands we send to a machine.\
Through code, we shape worlds, create cultures and refedine history. And I'm here ready to **weave my own story** with it.
