I recently read an [inspiring and hopeful article](https://www.citationneeded.news/we-can-have-a-different-web/) about the many ways of making the Web3 an amazing place to be. The article offered related links that discussed some of these ways. [One of those links](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) explained, in the clearest possible way, what **Digital Gardening** is.  
I learnt that, not only I found the idea compelling and resonating with me, but some of the _blogs_ I follow and like the most were actually digital gardens (or something along those lines). And so I decided to start my own by telling you about a seed I've planted already.

### Wait a second...

So, am i just renaming this blog a garden instead? Maybe. Or, maybe, I will change also the way I relate to it and the things I write in it. I guess we shall see.

### A seed from the past

I love to learn. And I also like to build, to create.  
I'm coming from an industry in which _learning something new_ meant to literally **make** something _new_, and that's [the approach I brought with me](https://www.mickeymarse.dev/blog/transferrable-skills/).

I also like novelty. And whatever is fresh. ~~And cute mascots.~~ Thus, me gravitating towards [people that are always discovering new tools or discussing arguments so niche they will always feel new](https://www.mickeymarse.dev/blog/what-is-life/).

So, it was no surprise I was amused by someone talking about the [BETH Stack](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=cpzowDDJj24). Or creating it more like. And, as anything in tech, especially when it's new tech, _it worked on his machine_.  
It did work on mine too eventually, and, even though I will never use any of those tools ever again, I had fun. And, although it's early stages, my plan of building [a tarot API](https://github.com/mickeymarse/tarmarapi) worked pretty well.

But that wasn't enough.

I knew about Ruby, this zen language with a human-like syntax, and I saw they had a [20 minutes tutorial](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/) on their website. [I love when they have their own tutorials](). On top of that, it could be run via terminal. So simple.

(_I later found out there was also an [in-browser\_ version](https://try.ruby-lang.org/), which I completed anyway._)

It wasn't much, but I was hooked. So, I kept on learning and then I moved to Ruby on Rails and that blew my mind. It makes React and all of the other JS framework seems so basic. No one uses it though. I wanted to anyway. Hence, I thought of building a [cute little nerdy app](https://github.com/mickeymarse/metrak) to link to my webspace.

Done.

At that point, I was on a roll.

I learnt Python for a job application and i loved it. And I get why the rest of the world does too. So, I thought of not just expanding my webspace, but also changing it. [I was sick of it]() soon after I finished it. Although, I didn't want to just change it. I was using it as an opportunity to, well, learn. And try new recipes. And Python meant [re-building the blog]() using Django. And, on the side, creating [another tarot API]() using FastAPI.

Uff! I'm planting a lot. Maybe I should stop?  
No, babe, you can't stop me.

There is also this very big beast I want to learn that is Rust. From my ignorant sit, it looks like it will be harder than those other languages. If anything, it will take longer. But I will use it as a culmination of this first planting phase. I will use the Yew framework to build a [new landing page/portfolio]() for my webspace. [Or maybe not](https://www.mickeymarse.dev/blog/no-trust/).  
After that, I will start looking into [building an operative system](https://os.phil-opp.com/) with Rust and that will take the rest of my life.

Bonus seed will be learning [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) and maybe build a small [tarot reading app]() for my APIs?

### Are you done?

Wait until I tell you about [the coding side of things]().

### I feel like you're cheating...

I probably am. Depending on when I will be posting this. I'm writing it down with the aim on going back and fill all the hyperlinks with the right URLs. As accountability towards myself. As a way to remind myself to tend to the garden. As a cheat to pretend my garden is bigger than it is.

Well, in any case, I like it.  
At whatever stage it is right now.  
It's exciting. And it smells very nice.  
Please, don't step on the flowers. And water the herbs on your way out.
