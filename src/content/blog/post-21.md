- The first meetup of che **Creative Coding Bookclub** happened and it was so nice. It was mostly an occasion to get to know each other and set commin goals, but it was cute. Next time we will discuss and showcase [randomness](https://natureofcode.com/random/).
- I had a delicious _pisca andina_ cooked by my partner. It was the first time they ever made it and now I'm obsessed.
- I facilitated my first retro at work. It was nice and fun. Some important points have been raised which we then discussed also beyond the retro.
- I went to the **_Work in progress_ exhibition** by some Goldsmith's students. It was about digital art and that realms of things. Some very nice things, some very WIP things. I hope I will be able to attend (if there will be) the final exhibition in order to witness the progress.
- Went to dance to [fake[dac~]](https://ra.co/events/1976423) and so glad I did. I was very tired on the day and I was about to miss it, then, a friend conviced me to go and I had so much fun as well as discovering a new cool artist.
