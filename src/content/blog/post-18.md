First time doing this and I don't have any actual notes. But I promised myself I was going to do it anyway so here we go.  

- First week back at work felt more intense than I expected. But I did my first spike and first demo and they received a good feedback. Have to demo it again to more stakeholders because it might actually become reality. I've collaborated with [my mentor](https://abiddiscombe.dev/) who's been very supportive throughout.
- Finally received my [Keychron V10 Max](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-v10-max-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard)!!! I'm getting used to the new layout, but I love the whole experience so far. The backlight effect is something I didn't think I was going to be so much into. I need to add the custom buttons so I can start using them at work too.  
- Also started using ergonomic mice. They're both Logi. The *ball one* is actually uncomfortable for me. I'm sticking with the vertical one for now.  
- I watched [Anora](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28607951/) twice and you should too.  
- Went to a queer rave during the weekend, but had a horrible time. Not the crowd I expected. And way bigger than I thought. I love parties, only when they are not over the *medium* size. I want a manageble crowd and venue. I don't want to queue for anything. I don't want to walk too much to find the rooms. I just want to dance and have fun in a moderately crowded place. Is that too much?  
- Found out about [Lem](https://lem-project.github.io/), which feels like a pocket terminal-only version of Emacs, with a more opinionated starting setup. It's nice and I'm currently using it to write this post. However, I will go back to focus on Emacs after this since I'm still learning that. Sorry, Lem, I promise I'll be back.                                              
- Read a blog post about [this book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60138088-the-flowering-wand) on *rewilding the sacred masculine*. It comes at it from a trans perspective of course and touches on mushroom and decoloniality. It made me think a lot about my own relationship with the masculine, especially since I came out as tranfem/transenby. And I haven't even read the book! I will surely buy it soon.  
- Spent loads of time looking at screens. Not a very social week, the next one will be busier though.  
- Finally started my weekly notes inspired by [Olu Online](https://olu.online/), who you should follow and read and watch on any platform.
