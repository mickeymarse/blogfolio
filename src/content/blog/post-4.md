I make promises.  
I say I will write or build things or learn and study things. Then, I don't. And it's okay with me. I'm still probably writing, building, learning or studying, just something else more likely.

This brain, uff, doesn't stop. Sometimes is a pain.

But I might create expectations and then don't deliver because this space is mine after all and so are its rules.

So, yeah, if you're prone to _brokenheartedness_, just assume every promise I make is a lie. ~~Just assume everything is a lie as far as I'm concerned.~~ Don't trust me.

**Have faith in me.**
