- I missed a week. This month has been intense. Two weekends ago, my body force me to bed and I was sick until Tuesday. I didn't take any time off before, during and after the move, so I'm glad I'm going away for a bit next week. Now my room is almost ready. I also have a cozy gaming corner in which I will soon place my new Steam Deck!!! Anyhow, no more moving talking.
- I lied. last weekend I went to clean my old flat before giving back the keys. I cleaned the fridge and spent most of the time getting rid of the ice from the freezer. It was an unexpectedly satisfying experience. Which I'm happy to not repeat again anyway.
- Having some fun at work playing around with [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/).
- I also spento so much time on [Amelia Wattenberger](https://wattenberger.com/)'s website in the hope I will find a reason to use **D3** at work one day. I would like to learn to use it anyway, potentially by saving the money and get [her book + course](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-d3). There's also another [book + course](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-react-with-typescript) on the same website I have my eyes on. I have a weakness for trashy neon 3D illustrations.
- I found out that Co-Star is built in Haskell. Which was a random fun fact per se. What I wasn't expecting was a [blog post](https://www.costarastrology.com/why-haskell/) from them explaining **why** they chose Haskell. Interesting read.
- I've also enjoyed reading [blog posts](https://blog.vbuckenham.com/the-case-for-definitions/) about other [blog posts](https://www.todepond.com/sky/okay-fine-ill-define-live-coding/). Love this new old long form way of commenting.
- Speaking of blog posts, [this one](https://dillo-browser.github.io/topic/playing-multimedia/) from Dillo popped up on my Mastodon feed and it reminded me of this fun little browser I once installed on my laptop and barely used. So I opened it again and, once again, I don't know if I hate it or love it.
- Finally ordered a new laptop because I think the current one is about to say farewell. I eventually landed on the [Framework 13](https://frame.work/gb/en/laptop13), which I wasn't expecting to. But I had to make a decision sooner than I expected and this was the most reliable thing I could afford.
- I'm trying to finish [a website](https://github.com/mickeymarse/21-sid-website) I promised a friend a while ago. What happened is that the project was way funnier at the beginning. Now is not. It is what it is though and I don't want to let them down. Also, I'm very close to finishing it. I need a final strong push. That Instagram API though...

~~the end~~
