Moving is tiring.
And expensive.
Without even taking into account how expensive it is to live in London.

I'm moving after 6 years living in the same flat. It's been the second longest I've been in a place after my parents home. I left that home 9 years ago because I needed a change. I'm leaving this one now because of gentrification.

I should probably go to sleep rather than keep writing this because tomorrow I'm working and packing again.

The new flat is great though. So spacious. It's going to be an improvement. Levelling up. That doesn't take away from the fact that moving is tiring though.

I also took almost 24 hours to manage to upload this using my phone. I definitely need to find a working workflow. I like the idea of writing and uploading using the phone. But this is too much.

We want easy. We want smooth. Hopefully the move will be too.

I'm moving tomorrow. Uff!
