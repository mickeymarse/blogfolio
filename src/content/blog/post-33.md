- I renamed this section, but kept the same numbering.
- Ages ago, TikTok showed me [a random video from this guy](https://youtu.be/TFIyYQ7id1Y) which immediately made me obsess with its subject: **Chongqing**, the city with many levels/tiers/layers. I think the technical term generally used is tiers, but don't trust me on that. Anyhow, every now and then I go back to it, looking at videos and photos because it's genuinely mind-blowing to me. I know nothing about it beside the way it looks, and one day I might do a proper research in the hope I will see it with my own eyes before the world ends. But, for now, it's mostly photos, and there are some good ones [here](https://thetowerinfo.com/chongqing-futuristic-city/).
- The comic book artist I inderectly mentioned in my [previous post](../week-recap-11), has also released a TTRPG called [Cain](https://tombloom.itch.io/cain) which looks equally cool. The things you find on _itch.io_...
- I discovered [Planet Snapshots](https://medium.com/@planetsnapshots) as it ended thanks to an internal newsletter at work. It's one of those things it doesn't matter it' _finished_ though because you can simply go back to it and savour those beautiful satellite photos over and over again. And if you've been through them so much you're sick of it, the editor started [their own Substack](https://substack.com/@ryderkimball) so you can go there for fresher snaps.
- And moving onto the realm of _immaterial geographies_, [The Deleted City](http://deletedcity.net/) is a map-like data visualisation of the archived Geocities right before they were **deleted** by Yahoo!. The map is old and possibly not maintained anymore, but you can find the whole packaged archive [here](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/GeoCities) if you're interested. If you're only interested in the GIFs from that universe, your wishes [may come true](https://gifcities.org/) as well.
