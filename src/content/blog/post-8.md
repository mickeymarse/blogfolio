Short answer: **There is no short answer**.  
Long answer: I guess you might as well start by reading this.

### Past

I started binge watching the **Sandpond Saga** from its very [first episode](https://youtu.be/zLP4ZwudAKs). It is a beautiful thing created by [an amazing coder](https://www.todepond.com/). But we're not here to talk about this. We're here to talk about another video mentioned and linked in this episode number one. A video by [Dave Ackley](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~ackley/) about [Artificial Life](https://youtu.be/YJRRu4dJnTI).

He's cool. Wise. Stunning demoing skills. He made ~~loads of~~ some people rethink about the way we code through his studies. He's my latest [mentor crush](https://www.mickeymarse.dev/blog/mentor-crush). And you should just watch [all his video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClOeW4P8ekXaKxJaZU_LK6w) if you haven't yet. They aren't many. For my binge-watching standards, that is.

Anyhow, artificial life we were saying.

### Present

I've recently had a nice introduction to [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) thanks to [MadLab](https://www.madlab.org.uk/). Yes, I could've just as easily learnt it by myself in a couple of days, but why doing that when I could do it with a group of people over three weeks instead? Aquarius reigns.

And so I thought of building a simple **AL** to show to my lovely blog readers. _Yes, you're one of them, and you're lovely!_

<h6 style="margin:auto; padding-left:23rem; padding-right:23rem;padding-bottom:3rem"><small>As it runs, it could slow down your connection. Stop it accordingly. You can find the code <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mickeymarse/artificial-artificial-life">here</a>.</small></h6>

This is nothing, just a little silly thing, but it made me think:

- There is so much more to JavaScript than e-commerce;
- There is so much more to programming/coding (_pick your fighter_) than just sending HTTP requests to ChatGPT;
- Creation and innovation don't really happen in the tech bubble, but somewhere else, as per usual;
- I still need a job and this is not helping.

### Future

It all started with Dave Ackley and Lu Wilson, but then you just keep looking and there seems to be so much _food for brain_ out there.

Yes, I love building my **media tracker** because I'm a nerd. However, for the same reason, I know I will find even more satisfaction in **creating my own language** to communicate to my own _quirky engine_. Oh, this without even touching on the plans regarding [building an OS](https://os.phil-opp.com/).

It's a lot, but I'm not planning to die anytime soon, so, I think I can do it.

I will probably start from buying some [nerdy book](https://www.mickeymarse.dev/blog/read-books). They help with making you feel smart, don't they?
