- This week was weird. I felt busy and like I wasn't doing much at the same time. Hence, I didn't write any notes, so I will try to remember things now on the spot.
- We announced the [next date](https://lu.ma/calendar/cal-l8dqsc8YHhI2Fbi) of the **Creative Coding Bookclub** I'm helping organise, and my co-host [Luis](https://luis.earth/) quickly setup an [amazing website](https://creativecodingbook.club/) using Astro!
- I found out about this [beautiful work of technomancy](https://sigil-seance.diagram.institute/radical-futures-2024/) (not sure if that's their preferred term, it's one of the many) that was part of [a broader exhibition](https://somos-arts.org/casting-a-spell/) of which I found out too late. Another one of those.
- Read [the second post](https://queerginiawolf.substack.com/p/giochi-post-lavoristi-e-gioia-di) from the new newsletter of a friend. It's about cozy games and labour. And about queerness and liberation because why not. It's in Italian.
- Currently obsessed with [this song](https://joshuaidehen.bandcamp.com/track/mum-does-the-washing) shared by a friend.
- I cooked a delicious pasta with _peperoni cruschi_.
- I had to pay half the price of the purchase in fees to get a keyboard that's been delivered from Hong Kong. Love borders and capitalism.
