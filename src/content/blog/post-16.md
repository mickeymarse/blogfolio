Again.  
And it was very fun.  
This time, they did a [one day event](https://www.peckhamdigital.org/programme/) with three workshops and an [Algorave](https://algorave.com/) performance.

I only attended the _Hacking the Browser_ workshop by the amazing [Joana Chicau](https://joanachicau.com/), and, even though I use the browser console on a daily basis for work now, it's a totally different experience to use it to make the `body` dance and breath and drift. And it made me realise I should try to keep up with _Vanilla_ JavaScript. I don't want to lose it. Because, when all the frameworks will fall, JS will still be there.

> Any application that can be written in Javascript, will eventually be written in Javascript.

And that's true for something I will mention later.  
Before that, I wanted to mention the [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/) workshop by [hellocatfood](https://linktr.ee/hellocatfood) and [tygerblue](https://linktr.ee/tygerblue) which I sadly chose to willingly missed. I already have a long list of things to learn, couldn't add this too. ðŸ˜ž

Finally, in the evening, there was Algorave and as always the performances were amazing and the performers lovely human beings. That's something I'm appreciating about the London (creative) coding scene: everyone seems to be genuinely nice. Yes, I'm sure there is an asshole here an there (it might be me), but, overall, I always find myself in a room full of kind nerds who want to discuss nerd stuff (or seeing other people doing it).

In fact, it was during one of these events that I met [Laura](https://github.com/lauraporta) with whom I immediately bonded (it might not be the same for her, but, well, too late not to be awkward). And it was so great to see her sign up for the Algorave open slot and do a 10-minute perfomance using [hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?sketch_id=rangga_0).  
She was so hyped at the end of it and that hyped me too. So, I promised I _study_ by the time the [next Algorave](https://ra.co/events/2015665) happens so to join her in the open slot!

We'll see if I can keep up with my own promises.

And since we need music to pair with Laura's visual, my tool of choice will be [a JavaScript port of a Haskell app](https://strudel.cc) (I told you we were going back to that quote).

And that's an esoteric snippet I produced while doing the tutorial to prove I'm serious:

That's all for today.  
Throw money at Peckham Digital if you can, or tell the wealthy people you know to, so beautiful things can keep happening.
