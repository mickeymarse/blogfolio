- I MOVED!
- I've been watching loads of cool series lately and I don't know why I haven't mentioned them yet.
  - Slowly watching **Serial Experiments Lain**. It is a reminder of the many weird and disturbing things we were creating towards the end of the 90s/beginning of the 2000s. and the wayt we thought about the internet back then.
  - Series 3 of **Invincible** is fun. With loads of blood and gore, but fun.
  - I was liking this new **Spider-Man** animated series, although I'm not sure why they would assemble a very diverse cast, but keep a very old school Peter Parker. However, the ending that doesn't end really killed it for me.
  - The latest **Harley Quinn** (Series 5?) is good, but they should bring it to an end before ruining it.
  - The first two episodes of the new season of **Severance** were so bad I was giving up. Luckily, it went back on track from episode 3. The concept is not one that can be exploited for too long. So, I really hope they won't destroy this gem by dragging it out for far too long.
- I MOVED AND IT WAS STRESSFUL!
- The move meant leaving [my favourite indie cinema](https://thecastlecinema.com/) behind. Which is very sad. Hope I can find another good one in the area.
- The second meetup of the [bookclub](https://creativecodingbook.club/), and the first one were we actually discussed the book, was actually quite fun and good.
- One day I should talk about the things I self-host and my relatiohship with self-hosting. But, for now, I just want to say I like **Miniflux** so much and that I find what might be my favourite clients to read my feed. _Minifluttt_ on my phone and tablet (Android) and _Reactflux_ from desktop/browser.
- I MOVED!
