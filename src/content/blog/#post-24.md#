- This week just flew by and it was very busy in terms of work somehow.
- Speaking of work, a post written by me was published in the internal company blog. And there was a very beautiful photo of myself with it.
- I was also in Southampton for two days. That's where the HQ is. On Fridays, the canteen does English Breakfast and that's so lush, especially given the quality and the low price.
- I spent Thursday on a videocall with two friends, mostly doing a tarot reading. I will write a post about how I approach tarots and readings.
- I went to another open deck, this time at The Queen Adelaide, a not enough busy queer pub in Hackney. Give it a go if you're around.
- I'm slowly building my Emacs config. It's super fun!
- A friend that I haven't seen in two years saw my makeup and thought it was a new face tattoo and now the idea got stuck in my mind. And I like it.
- Done some admin for the imminent moving. Need to start packing. Sigh!
