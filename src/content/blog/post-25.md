- Late notes because I'm moving. **After 6 years**. Because of gentrification mostly. I am also gentrification in a way. Or possibly in all the ways. It's something I haven't spent too long thinking about yet. I know I should. It's just that London sucks your soul (and money) away.
- _I will try to remember what happened last week, but I haven't taken any notes because it was a stressful one, so I'll do my best._
- Went to my  first **London Live Coding** meetup on Tuesday. It was fun. One of the most nerdy events I possibly have been. I had to leave before the jam session though because I had already spent the whole day in the office and was so so so tired. The only downside is that's in a pub, but it's so hard to find spaces in London that we take what we get. I've been true this hard truth quite often.
- Meet a friend after 2 years. London, eh? Went to one of the community gardens where they work. They showed me around. I might end up helping with their mushroom growing. Just because I don't do enough.
- I missed the **London Creative Coding** meetup and I didn't even cancel my ticket. Bad karma? It was very last minute so I don't know if anyone would have been able to reschedule their life with such a short notice. This is London after all.
- I honestly only remember about the things I have in the calendar, but I know I've done more than that. Damn!
- Saturday it was the turn of **Creative Coding Crafts Space**. We did a very fun workshop on Three.js and I probably found another way to waste some money. After the workshop, I stayed over chilling at the space, chatting with people and looking at them doing stuff because I had no energy to either leave or do anything.
- I did two tarot readings on Sunday. Very different vibes, but both interesting. I need to write that post about tarots.
- I also need to write about London clearly.
