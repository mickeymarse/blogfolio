- I didn't take a break after the move and I kept working while fixing my room and unpacking and this weekend my body gave up. I'm feeling better now.
- I managed to publish the event for [the second meetup](https://lu.ma/dul7dg8r) of the Creative Coding Bookclub despite the sickness.
- I started using [Floorp](https://floorp.app/en) and I love it.
- My new neighbours are actually nice and friendly. This is the first time in my life.
- After the browser from Japan, I might try [this framework](https://lynxjs.org/index.html) from China. Love some good competition for the USians monopolies.
- The new area where I live feels very Mediterranean, almost _homey_.
- Found out about the crowdfunding of [a supercool Palestiniang videogame](https://www.launchgood.com/v4/campaign/palestine_skating_game__grind_shoot_paint__do_graffiti_to_arabic_electronic_music). Sadly, it's not getting any traction. If you're even barely interested and have the capacity, please consider donating and supporting.
- I made some progress on my new blogfolio. I didn't think about all the steps I had to take to achieve what I wanted. I will write a post about it for sure. I need to write posts about many things besides these weekly notes. They're starting to be a easy lazy win for my brain.
