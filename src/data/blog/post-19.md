- I really want to go to the [live coding conference in Barcelona](https://iclc.toplap.org/2025/). I like both Barcelona and live coding, so I think have them together at the same time is a deal I can't miss.
- We've announced the first date of the [Creative Coding Bookclub](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/creative-coding-bookclub-meetup-1-tickets-1144165593089) I'm helping organise. We will read the latest edition of **The Nature of Code**. I'm excited especially because I will be finally hold accountable for going through that brick of a book.
- I'm using more and more Emacs. I have Spacemacs on my laptop and the Purcell config on the work one.
- I found out about the new [MNT crowdfunded laptop](https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/mnt-reform-next) and I'm in love. I was about to get the Framework, but I might have changed my mind. This one is so queer it's hot.
- I got SPAM (the meat) this week and I fondly regret it even though I deeply desired it. I had it together with eggs. My stomach is still too vegan for all of this.
- I found (and listened to) this [amazing mix](https://on.soundcloud.com/GVwHti9UuooXyvKG6) on Soundcloud (which logo is now black???). I love listening to good mixes while working/writing.
- I finally learned the basics of Org Mode and Elisp. The next step will be to start creating my own config file from scratch(ish).

~~the end~~
