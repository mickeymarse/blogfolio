- Work has been hard this week. Loads of admin and learning. Admin is annoying, but learning can be fun. Not all learning though.
- I went to an [_open decks_](https://dalstonsuperstore.com/event/queer-open-decks-14/) on Monday at **Dalston Superstore** and it was so fun! I went with a friend who was performing and it was my first time so didn't know what to expect. But it makes sense of course. Open mics can't be the only open performances.
- I cooked calaloo and polenta (in two separate occasions) and failed. I didn't follow any recipe, I improvised, but none of them is something that I generally have so it was a bit of a risk. It's totally on me. I ate them all anyway.
- I discovered that **.ass** is a subtitles format and not a joke thanks to [this very interesting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEDFUjqA1s8) which you should watch especially if you like people finding creative ways to mess up with _AIs_.
- I went to the _Dark Fantasies_ screening of the [London Short Film Festival](https://www.shortfilms.org.uk/) (which doesn't let you check past programmes?). It was about eroticism in horror movies. Unexpectedly fun. Sad to have found out the festival started so late. I missed some veery good screenings.
- Got a tattoo the [Burned House Horizon](https://www.mimosahouse.co.uk/burned-house-horizon) exhibition at **Mimosa House**. It's on until the 9th of February and you should visit too if you like witchcraft and ancient mystical cultures.
- Went to the third meetup of [Creative Coding Crafts Space](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/creative-coding-crafts-space-meetup-3-electric-dreaming-tickets-1143059364329) and it keep being such a chill and good vibes space. It also seem like there is never enough time to do all the things we want to do, but such is life I guess. I'm organising a [Creative Coding Bookclub](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/creative-coding-bookclub-meetup-1-tickets-1144165593089?aff=erelexpmlt) with their help by the way.
- I think I know what laptop I'm buying next (mine is currently dying sigh).
