It's been literally two months since my last post.
Life can be overwhelming.

Work has become busier for a combination of reasons, and lately we've been catching up with maintenance work, fixing vulnerabilities, upgrading packages, improving pipelines, all those things that make frontend development less exciting, in my opinion.
That got me tired by the end of the working day and also drained my coding capacity for the day, which led to two months of almost no coding outside of work.

Luckily, my friend Laura asked me if I will ever give her the website I promised I was going to build her I don't even remember when and then was a nice thing to bring up. [The state of the website](https://github.com/mickeymarse/21-sid-website) is still a bit far from MVP, but I'm having fun integrating **Sanity CMS** into my **NextJS** app and seeing, once again, how nothing actually integrates as easily as anyone promises in the software development world. :blush:

My other _WIP_ is [the rebuild of my _blogfolio_](https://codeberg.org/mickeymarse/undefined) (which will gain a better name for sure) in **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS** because why not? You always need new ways to create avenues for procastination. I'm finishing a first iteration of a very rouch Markdown parser and it's fun? I think?

In order to make my flow more complicated, I bought a new laptop soon after I moved into my new flat (because I needed one, I don't have space cash around for extra laptops). I got a **Framework 13**, because we like an easy-to-repair modular machine, and installed **NixOS** on it, which meant having to re-learn Linux once more. The declarative package manager written in **Nix** is a big departure from any other distro I've used before, but it's so nice to use once you start familiarising with it. And I'm loving the possibility of creating environments using the same language/system without the need of downloading and having to struggle with things like `nvm`, `conda` and whatnot. [This video](https://invidious.f5.si/watch?v=yQwW8dkuHqw) will explaing you what this means better than I ever could in case you're interested.

I've also reduced the number of things I'm _organising_ (they were a lot). Thankfully, because I tend not to do things on my own, they are all still thriving! The only one relevant to this blog is [Creative Coding Bookclub](https://creativecodingbook.club/) which is going to have its 5th event in three days! We need to thank the amazing [Luis](https://luis.earth/) for that as well as all the people taking part to it an helping in different ways. :heavy_heart_exclamation:

What else can I share?
- I enjoyed [this blog post](https://blog.vbuckenham.com/stop-using-p5-js/) about (not using) `p5.js`, as well as [its follow-up](https://blog.vbuckenham.com/i-learn-more-about-p5-js/). I love these kind of conversations.
- I used a [Secret Packs](https://www.berliner-kurier.de/berlin/neuer-mystery-automat-am-raw-gelaende-das-steckt-in-den-paketen-li.2241438) vending machine in Berlin and got a cam and a small LCD screen, both for IoT development. That reignited my interest in burning Arduino chips so I might go back into it soon.
- I've been catching up on some videogaming and TV shows I was meant to finish back in March. It was about time.
- I'm learning about cartography and GIS because why not nerd about even more stuff?
- I need to buy more olive oil.

I think that's all for now.
I hope I can find a sort of regularity again in my posting, but I won't promise that to myself because life is hard.
