- Recently, I've been playing (videogames) a lot as well as looked at video about videogames and read about videogames. I'm into narrative games, original gameplay and, in particular, anything that is weird, different, original. So, it was a matter of time before I would stumble upon [La Leyenda del Abuelo contra el Diablo](https://abuelo-vs-diablo.com/).
- Often times, like any work of art, games are more than ~~just~~ games. And this is ever more the case for **Palestine Skating Game** which is [currently crowdfunding](https://www.gofundme.com/f/palestine-skating-game-fundraiser), meaning it's time to show some support. They also have a [demo](https://palestineskatinggame.itch.io/prototype3) in case you want to go for a ride.
- And it's weird I've only now found out about [p5play](https://p5play.org/index.html), given my proximity to both these two domains. Weird to see they have a Pro license though. Haven't seen any other p5 or Processing library doing that. But I might be wrong?
- One game engine I was aware of and I think is nice, fun and easy to use is [Narrat](https://narrat.dev/), which is specifically aimed for narrative (eheh) and roleplaying games.
- All this gaming made me want to go back an binge-watch all the videos I missed from one of my favourite ~~YouTube~~ channel, that is [mara](https://www.youtube.com/@maraganger). They are the reason why my Steam and itch.io wishlists are full of the most niche and weird and quirky and intriguing and unsettling videogames. Most of them made with the eternal [RPG Maker](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/downloads), which is more pricey than when I used to pirate it in my teenage years.
- Adding a non-game-related entry because otherwise this should've been a proper blog post about videogames and me. I found out that the *unique* [TempleOS](https://templeos.org/) has [a fork](https://zealos.net/) with an even more unique name. Of course, also built in [Holy C](https://holyc-lang.com/).

~~the end~~
