- Found out about [OKLCH](https://oklch.com/) CSS color notation via this color picker and converter that was linked somewhere (possibly the `p5.js` blog post I mentioned in my [last post](/where-have-i-been)). There is a link in the picker/converter page to an article telling you more about OKLCH. I migh use it in [my website remake](https://codeberg.org/mickeymarse/undefined).
- The [Temporal API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal) is an experimental feature in Firefox 139+ and hopefully it will be implemented by other browsers soon enough. It will sostitute and improve on the `Date API`, which I had no idea how broken it was, haven't truly used it much yet. `Temporal` already looks more sexy though, starting from its name.
- There is [an explainer for web development using only vanilla techniques. No tools, no frameworks â€” just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://plainvanillaweb.com/), which will come very handy to me of course given the silly adventure I embarked on with the remaking of this space.
- The [Internet Phone Book](https://internetphonebook.net/) it's a hipster endeavour I will try to be part of if there will be a next time. It's sold out, but I subscribed to the mailing list in the hope to catch a copy. Can't believe no one in London is stocking it.
- If I had money to waste, I would buy all the crazy expensive shit that feeds my nerd soul. And this time and age provide you with so much crazy expensive shit to feed your soul. Like [Poetry Camera](https://poetry.camera/), a project I've been following *on-and-off* since its inception on social media and which I only this week I discovered became reality thanks to their talk at **Figma Config 2025**. That talk also reminded me that people in tech (not only engineers/developers) can be very cringy. Anyhow, another thing I will waste my money on is one of these [Smart Typewriter](https://getfreewrite.com/products/smart-typewriter-gen3-special-valentine-edition) I discovered via [Olu](https://olu.online/)'s blog. I owned two typewriter in the past and I've never written anything on them. I can't wait to regret buy a super expensive one so much!
- There are some very cool comics published on the internet and I can't believe I realised only recently I can add them to my RSS feed and catch up with the new chapters as they come out! My current fave is [Kill 6 Billion Demons](https://killsixbilliondemons.com/), which I highly recommend if you're okay with hyper violence and blasphemy.
- Had my first ever **Pastel de Pollo** cooked by my partner's Venezualan mom and I'm obsessed.
- I haven't bought any olive oil yet.
