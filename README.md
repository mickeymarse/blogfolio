# Mickey's Blogfolio

I created this website after completing the [**School of Code**](https://schoolofcode.co.uk/) bootcamp as a way to showcase my projects when applying for jobs and neyond. I then eventually decided to add a [**Blog**](https://www.mickeymarse.dev/blog) because I like to write and narrate stories. I thought it would've been a good idea to report on my journey into tech as a transfem career-changer.

I built it with [Astro](https://astro.build/), which is a very cool JS framework, ideal for static sites. If you're curious to learn more about it, it's very intuitive and the documentation is one of the best written and most accessible out there.

I did take advantage of the _Astro Island_ feature to build some of the components with **React**, a framework I'm more familiar with.  
I used **Tailwind** for styling and **Iconify** for the icons.  
There is also a touch of the eternal **jQuery**.

## Future Plans

&#9744; Implement E2E testing;  
~~&#9744; Launch the **Fiction** section;~~  
&#9744; Experiment with Svelte, Vue and Angular by switching some of the components;  
&#9744; Create tickets from the long TODO/FIXME tree produced in the code;  
&#9745; Restyle using a component library.
